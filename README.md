# REACT-TYPESCRIPT-BOILERPLATE

This is a sample code for testing `ts-loader` with `react-hot-loader`.  
The `transpileOnly: true` option is fundamental to make it works.  
See https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader#faster-builds for further details.

Check out the [next](https://github.com/bwlt/react-typescript-boilerplate/tree/next) branch for the same work with `react-hot-loader@next`
